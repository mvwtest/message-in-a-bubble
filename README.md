## Description

In "Message in a Bubble" the users do not simply communicate with plain text messages but instead
are using bubbles which apart from the message itself are referring to a set of coordinates in the
world map. The instant messaging protocol that "Message in a Bubble" uses is
the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](https://xmpp.org/). The backend of the
application is an [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/)
server and it is provided as a docker container connected to an external MySQL Database.
