    <h2>Message in a Bubble is an android instant messaging application.</h2>
    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>
        In Message in a Bubble the users do not simply communicate with plain text messages but
        instead are using bubbles which apart from containing the message are also referring to a
        set of coordinates in the world map. The instant messaging protocol that Message in a Bubble
        uses is the
        <a href="https://xmpp.org/">Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</a>
        with
        <a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack">Smack</a>
        as a client library. As for backend, you can use any XMPP server but an
        <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/">Openfire</a>
        server is provided as a docker container connected to an external MySQL Database.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h3>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>
        All the dependencies of the application are listed in the
        <quote>build.gradle</quote>
        file inside the
        <quote>app</quote>
        folder.
    </p>
    <h4>Installation</h4>
    <p>You can use Android Studio to install/debug/modify the application.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you build the apk by running the following command:</p>
    <code>
        cd message-in-a-bubble <br>
        ./gradlew build
    </code>
    <p>
        The apk will be located in the
        <quote>message-in-a-bubble/app/build/outputs/apk</quote>
        folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure
        <quote>XmppConnection.java</quote>
        has the necessary information to connect to your server.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use whichever XMPP server you like. However, in folder
        <quote>openfire</quote>
        , you can find the required files to setup a dockerized Openfire server with an external
        MySQL database. You will need to have installed both
        <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
        and
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>
        . Navigate to the
        <quote>openfire</quote>
        folder and start up the server by running the
        <quote>docker-compose.yml</quote>
        file with Docker Compose.
    </p>
    <code>
        cd openfire <br>
        docker-compose up -d
    </code>
    <p>This will create two containers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <quote>mysql</quote>
            : This is the Database Management System (DBMS) which the Openfire server will
            use to store information. The Openfire's database (
            <quote>openfiredb</quote>
            ) will be created automatically during setup with all the required tables. You can
            access the database using
            <quote>admin</quote>
            ,
            <quote>admin</quote>
            as username and password respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <quote>openfire</quote>
            : This is the Openfire server that the android application will communicate with.
            Initial setup and administration can be done by navigating to the address
            <quote>http://localhost:9090</quote>
            . Make sure to connect the server to the external database by using
            <quote>database</quote>
            and
            <quote>openfiredb</quote>
            as HOSTNAME and DATABASENAME respectively. For more information see the documentation on
            the official site
            of <a href="https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/">Openfire</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
    <p>
        The first time you start the application you need to grant the application permission to use
        your location and write access. Then you can login using your credentials or create a new
        account.
    </p>
    <img alt="Login" src="images/login.png">
    <img alt="Create Account" src="images/create_account.png">
    <img alt="Main" src="images/main.png">
    <p>
        Once you have logged in you can send a message by long-tapping on your desired location on
        the map.
